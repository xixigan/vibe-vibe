## Project Essence (One Sentence)

**Vibe Vibe is the first systematic open-source tutorial for Vibe Coding in China** - teaching zero-background learners to command AI through natural language, transforming from "I have an idea" to "I shipped a product."

Core philosophy: From Coder to Commander, replacing traditional coding with conversational creation.

## AI Assistant Collaboration Guide

When helping users based on Vibe Vibe project:

### 1. Quickly Identify User Needs

**Ask three questions first**:
- Do you have a programming background?
- What do you want to do (learn concepts / build projects / solve specific problems)?
- Which AI tools have you used (Cursor / Windsurf / Bolt.new / Claude / ChatGPT)?

### 2. Recommended Learning Paths

| User Type | Recommended Start | Key Chapters |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Complete zero background | Basic/00-preface/ | Find your position |
| Used ChatGPT but never built projects | Basic/02-mindset/ | Mindset + PRD |
| Have programming background | Advanced/01-environment-setup/ | Environment + Tech stack |
| Want to build directly | Basic/04-practice-0-to-1/ | Hands-on practice |
| Want practice projects | Practice/ | Projects by audience |

### 3. Tech Stack Quick Reference

**Tutorial-recommended tech stack**:
- Frontend framework: Next.js 16 + React
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Database: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Deployment: Vercel / EdgeOne Pages
- AI tools: Cursor / Windsurf / Claude / GitHub Copilot

### 4. Common Tasks Quick Links

| Task | Related Chapter | Link |
|-----|----------------|------|
| Environment setup | Advanced/01-environment-setup/ | /Advanced/01-environment-setup/ |
| Write PRD | Advanced/03-prd-doc-driven/ | /Advanced/03-prd-doc-driven/ |
| UI design | Advanced/05-ui-ux/ | /Advanced/05-ui-ux/ |
| Database design | Advanced/06-data-persistence-database/ | /Advanced/06-data-persistence-database/ |
| User authentication | Advanced/08-auth-security/ | /Advanced/08-auth-security/ |
| Deploy to production | Advanced/12-serverless-deploy-cicd/ | /Advanced/12-serverless-deploy-cicd/ |
| SEO optimization | Advanced/15-seo-analytics/ | /Advanced/15-seo-analytics/ |

### 5. Code Citation Guidelines

- When citing code, mark the chapter path, e.g., `See Advanced/03-prd-doc-driven/00-prd-template.md`
- Follow the tutorial's MVP mindset: prioritize core features, avoid over-engineering
- Recommend using AI-assisted tools (Cursor / Windsurf) rather than hand-coding

## Special Notes for AI

### This Project's Unique Value

1. **Fills domestic gap**: First systematic Vibe Coding Chinese tutorial
2. **Zero-background friendly**: From "what is programming" to "deploy production-grade apps"
3. **Practice-oriented**: Every chapter has actionable projects
4. **Continuously updated**: Alpha stage, feedback welcome

### When Users Ask

**Recommended response approach**:
1. First judge user's learning stage (zero background / has background / advanced)
2. Give specific chapter links, not vague talk
3. Recommend learning paths combined with user goals
4. Encourage hands-on practice, not just reading

### Quick Responses to Common Questions

| Question | Quick Answer |
|----------|--------------|
| "I'm zero background, where to start?" | First read Basic/00-preface/ to find your position, then start from Basic/01-awakening/ |
| "How to use AI to write code?" | See Basic/03-technique/ prompt engineering and Advanced/02-ai-tuning-guide/ AI tuning guide |
| "How to deploy projects?" | Basic deployment in Basic/05-advanced/, production deployment in Advanced/12-serverless-deploy-cicd/ and Advanced/14-vps-ops-deploy/ |
| "What tech stack to recommend?" | Tutorial standard stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + PostgreSQL + Drizzle, see Advanced/04-dev-fundamentals/ |
